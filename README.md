# What is this?
This is a playground for the Haskell programming language.  
I use this project to solve the 99 lisp questions on my own, and then note down some interesting solutions given on [here](https://wiki.haskell.org/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems).

# Why?
Haskell is much different than all the other languages I know to this day. I must change my strategy to learn it, adapt my way of thinking and approaching a problem. To better prepare myself for other challenges and get familiar with Haskell, I decided to solve these 99 questions.

Happy haskell-ing!
